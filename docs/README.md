The jivejs project has a plethora of useful and nifty things. These include:

- [Fabric](fabric.md)
- [Capped](capped.md)
- [State](state.md)
- [jPromise](https://github.com/jive/jPromise)
- [General Utils](util.md)
- [Data Models](dataModels.md)


For the others, for now, I recommend looking at the source code comments. They're actually pretty damn good.
